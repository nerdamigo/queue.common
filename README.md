# NerdAmigo Queue.Ccommon

Message queues are an essential component for distributed systems and the microservice based architecture. Regardless of the queue used, the general workflow for pushing, receiving, and processing messages is very similar and this project encapsulates those behavior leaving it to the actual IQueueClient implementation to take care of interacting with the service in question.
